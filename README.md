# tomePrompt CLI App
## 🕯️Welcome!🕯️

tomePrompt is a CLI App and Micro JRPG made with plain ole JavaScript. Currently I'm utilizing 2 libraries, @inquirer/prompts by SBoudrias for the CLI itself, and CLI-Frames by IonicaBizau for handling animations.

This project is still in early development, so keep your eyes peeled for updates!

Thanks!

Clone the repo, cd into the tomePrompt directory, and try out the current build with:
```bash
npm run tomePrompt
