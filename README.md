# 🕯️Hello! Welcome to **tomePrompt 🕯️
tomePrompt is a CLI App and Micro JRPG made with plain ole JavaScript. Currently I'm utilizing 2 libraries, [@inquirer/prompts](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js "GitHub Repo for @inquirer/prompts") by SBoudrias for the CLI itself, and [CLI-Frames](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/node-cli-frames "GitHub Repo for CLI-Frames") by IonicaBizau for handling animations.

This project is still in early development, so keep your eyes peeled for updates!

Thanks!

Clone the repo, cd into the tomePrompt directory, and try out the current build with:
```bash
npm run tomePrompt
